## Description

WazirX Top 10 Trading Pairs Tracker is a Node.js application that fetches real-time trading data from the WazirX API, sorts the trading pairs based on their volume, and displays the top 10 trading pairs with their last traded price. It uses Express.js as the server framework, Axios for making API requests, and Mongoose to connect and store the top 10 results in a MongoDB database.

The main features of the app are:
- Fetching real-time trading data from the WazirX API.
- Sorting trading pairs based on their trading volume.
- Displaying the top 10 trading pairs with their last traded price.
- Saving the top 10 trading pairs to a MongoDB database for future reference.
